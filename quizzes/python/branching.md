# Python Branching

-------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

This quiz focuses on Python commands that allow your program to make decisions as to what to do next (we call this 'branching').

In each question you will be shown a short snippet of Python code, like this:

```python
if age >= 18:
    print( "You are an adult" )
```

You will be asked to either *predict* what it does, or to suggest  *changes* that would fix / alter the code in some way.

### Notes on Branching:

* `if` - simple decision
* `if ... else` - a simple decision with two branches
* `if ... elif ... else` - multiple decisions and branches

## Question 1

The `print()` command is used to display information on the screen for the user. Take a look at this code...

```python
print( "Hello World!" )
```

### What will the code do?

1. It will show the text `Hello World!`
2. It will ask a question
3. It will display an error

This is a very common use of the `print()` command, showing a string (text) to the user.

Strings must have speechmarks at the start and end: "..." or '...'
