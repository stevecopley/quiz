## Introduction

This quiz focuses on the Python commands for displaying information (*output*) and requesting information (*input*). 

In each question you will be shown a short snippet of Python code, like this:

```python
print( "Python is awesome!" )
answer = input( "Do you agree? " )
```

You will be asked to either *predict* what it does, or to suggest  *changes* that would fix / alter the code in some way.

### Notes on Input and Output

The `print()` command is used to *output* (show) information to the user:

* To show the text *Hello!* to the user, you would write: `print( "Hello!" )` (note the speech marks around the text)
* To show the number *42* to the user, you would write: `print( 42 )` (no speech marks needed for numbers)
* To display a blank line, you would write: `print()`

The `input()` command is used to *input* (ask for) information from the user:

* To ask the user for their name, you would write: `name = input( "Name: " )` (note that a *variable* is needed to store the response from the user, in this case *name*)
* To ask the user for their age, you would write: `age = int( input( "Age: " ) )` (note that the `int()` command is used to convert the input into an actual *integer* number)

This is a very common use of the `print()` command: showing some text (a *string*) to the user. 

Strings must have *speech marks* at the start and end: `"..."` or `'...'`
