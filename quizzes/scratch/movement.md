## Introduction

This quiz focuses on *sprite movement* in Scratch:

Use the *next* and *previous* question arrows above to move between questions.

In each question you will be shown a set of Scratch code blocks, like this:

```scratch
onflag
goto (0) (0)
point (45)

stage [grid]
  spriteinfo (x: 100) (y: -50) (angle: 45)
  spriteinfo (x: -150) (y: -80) (angle: -90) (i:bee)
  sprite (i:beetle1)  (x: -200) (y: 100) (s:50)
  sprite (i:beetle2)  (x: -100) (y: 100) (s:50)
  sprite (i:beetle3)  (x:    0) (y: 100) (s:50)
  sprite (i:ladybird) (x:  100) (y: 100) (s:50)
  sprite (i:ant)      (x:  200) (y: 100) (s:50)
endstage
```

You will be asked to either *predict* what it does, or to suggest  *changes* that would fix / alter the code in some way.

### Notes on Movement

* The `move (100)` block will move a sprite in the direction it is facing

```
